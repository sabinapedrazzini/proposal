# Societal problem

Since several years, we are facing many global crises, both on the climate and on the social level. For instance, we recently went through a global pandemic, several natural disaster such as fires and floods, wars with consequent humanitarian emergencies, and an important rising in the cost of living. To address these problems, 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) were created during the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The aim was to "produce a set of universal goals that meet the urgent environmental, political and economic challenges facing our world" (United Nations Development Program, n.d.). However, according to the latest Global Sustainable Development Report (2023), ten years later the establishment of these goals, we are still far from achieving them[^1]. It is not too late to improve the future perspective and to approach the realization of SDGs, but a radical social and economic change is needed. In fact, if we stay on a "business-as-usual pathway", the goals will not be achieved by 2030, or even 2050 (GSDR, 2023). At the same time, @Steffen2015 proposed the Planetary Boundaries Framework, based on the biophysical processes regulating the stability of the Earth system. This framework defines nine "planetary boundaries", the most important of which are climate change and biosphere integrity. If not overshot, these boundaries insure a safe operating space for human activities. According to the latest update of the Stockholm Resilience Center (2023), six boundaries are already crossed.

[^1]: More specifically, between the measurements of 2019 and 2023, a regression was observed in goals concerning air pollution, agricultural water use, relative poverty rates, food waste, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity and nitrogen use. There were minimal progress on goals related to malnutrition and gender gap, while gains were observed only in few areas such as extreme poverty reduction and global income convergence.

In order to develop a new model for human well-being, @Raworth2017 combined the United Nations' SDGs with the Planetary Boundaries Framework. In her approach, "well-being depends on enabling every person to lead a life of dignity and opportunity, while safeguarding the integrity of Earth's life-supporting systems" [@Raworth2017, p.1]. Her model (shown in Figure 1) allows to define a safe and just space for humanity. The inner boundary (social foundation) is composed by the social-related SDG; a minimum level is necessary to attain these goals. On the other side, the ecological ceiling is based on the Planetary Boundaries Framework and ideally should not be overshot.

![Figure 1. Doughnut with social foundations as inner boundary and ecological ceiling as outer boundary.\

These frameworks are useful to understand the global situation, and highlight the most urgent aspects that need to be improved, both at the environmental and at the social level. However, the path to attain these goals is not the same for every country. In fact, at the moment there are no countries that satisfy the basic needs of human well-being while using the resources in a globally sustainable way. On one hand, countries in Global North generally ensure their population's well-being, but they also overshoot most of the planetary boundaries. On the other hand, in Global South the planetary boundaries are usually respected, but people's needs are not (fully) met [@ONeill2018].

Although the actual situation would suggest that well-being is met only when planetary boundaries are exceeded, more and more scholar argue that there is another solution: degrowth. This term indicate a radical change on the political and economic level to drastically reduce resource consumption [@Kallis2018]. The goal is to create a socially and ecologically sustainable society, that is not based on economic growth [@Euler2019]. In fact, the current capitalistic system is "structurally unsustainable, because it builds on structures of insufficiency --- there is no"enough" to it" [@Euler2019, p. 2]. Therefore, this planned reduction of production and consumtption is seen as a solution to the current socio-ecological crises, and is deemed necessary, desirable, and possible [@Fitzpatrick2022; @Schmelzer2022].

## The commons[^2] as a solution

[^2]: The term "commons" is both singular and plural [@Bollier2014]. For the difference between the singular forms "common" and "commons", see @Feinberg2021.

commons: solution for 2 reasons:

-   they can help to attain degrowth

-   they improve well-being while respect planetary boundaries

Since they can assume various forms, commons have been defined in many ways. In fact, according to @Bollier2014 "they can arise whenever a community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability". Therefore, commons represent a way for people to self-organized to adress shared problems [@Bollier2019]. The variety of definitions could be resumed through three key points. First, the commons' goal is to manage shared resources, goods, or territories [@Ostrom1990; @Meroni2022; @Schmelzer2022]. In general, commons allow to find solutions for the needs of the affected people [@Euler2018; @Euler2019]. Secondly, commons are managed by a self-organized community of users [@Ostrom1990] and they are based on participatory principles [@Seravalli2018]. The community is engaged in creating the commons and in defining rules to successfully manage it, and both these practices and the community can be seen as part of the commons itself [@Meroni2022; @Bollier2014]. The process through which people come together to find solutions, and to create institutions to govern the commons is called "commoning" [@Euler2018; @Schmelzer2022]. Given the essential role of the community in defining a common, considering the characteristics of the specific group of people who is commoning is crucial to have a full understanding of the commons itself [@Dove2019]. Finally, commons are not organized around the generalized market competition [@Euler2019] and do not involve the classic private and public model [@Ostrom1990].

In summary, commons represent an alternative to the capitalist system, and they are a possible way to attain degrowth [@Euler2019]. In fact, in degrowth literature, aspects related to commons are mentioned as potential changes toward a new social and economic organization. For example, in @Fitzpatrick2022, guarantee the decommodified and universal provision of fundamental humans needs, promote shared housing, and prioritize self-sufficient communities are part of the objectives that could allow to attain degrowth. Moreover, a shift toward a more democratic economy is also needed, and to realize it commons, solidarity economy, democratic ownership and institutional support for cooperative are essential [@Schmelzer2022].

\
@Fitzpatrick2022: - theme "energy & environment": energy democracy made of convivial, community-owned and operated renewable energy systems\
- theme "food": food as political, so every community should be able to determine its food system, seed commons\
- theme "governance & geopolitics": defence and reclaiming of the commons via the local, democratic ownership of essential infrastructure such as banking, energy, education, healthcare, local government, telecommunications, transport, waste, and water\
- theme "production & consumption": democratic, not-for-profit business models such as cooperatives, self-production, smaller businesses, and commons-based peer production; encouraging voluntary simplicity (bike infrastructures, co-housing, shared utilities, repair cafes, decommodified hobbies)\
- theme "urban planning": guarantee decent, affordable homes for everyone by protecting the housing sector from commodification and speculation; Housing sufficiency promotes alternative housing arrangements such as ecovillages, eco-cohousing, housing cooperatives, or squatting. It also promotes common facilities (e.g. cars, gardens, kitchens) and retrofitting programs to significantly lower the ecological footprint of dwellings

@Schmelzer2022: + 6 clusters grouping proposal for degrowth pathaways, the 1) involving commons: "democratization, solidarity economy, and commoning" =\> initiatives such as collectively managed common properties, solidary economies or community-based agricultural systems should be defended against the competition of neoliberal markets, but also the degrowth policies should create the conditions for their expansion "The defense of existing commons and the expansion of production methods based on commons principles can be seen as a central component of a degrowth economy"

URBAN COMMONS

@Gidwani2011: reference to say that researches about commons usually focused on rural ones, but that urban are more and more included (but for urban common they intend public spaces and services of cities, and especially in developing countries where these commons are more at risk) + interesting points for the definition (see parts in red)

@Feinberg2021: "The urban commons has gained a growing interest over the past decade, both in the field and in the scientific community" + interesting elements for the definition of commons

@Feinberg2021: Urban commons initiatives are not bound to physical or digital infrastructures. What makes them new commons is not the physical infrastructure, the floor, the walls, the shops or any other visible amenity that may become a "collective good", but the atmospheres created by users passing by or gathering: a transit space created by informal socializing

Look for @Hess2008 and the classification of new commons =\> read the paper!

=\> show that commons are good both for individual well-being and for the environment, so that they could help to attain the "good life for everybody within the planetary boundaries"

-   challenge in commons: social dilemma =\> temptation to pursue personal interest, but if everybody does so the commons will fail

define cooperation + literature on cooperation

@Poteete2010a: Research based on field studies, laboratory and field experiments, game theory, and agent-based models has conclusively demonstrated that it is possible for individuals to act collectively to manage shared natural resources on a sustainable basis

@Bollier2014: "Hardin's fictional scenario sets forth a system that has no boundaries around the pasture, no rules for managing it, no punishments for over-use and no distinct community of users. But that is not a commons . It is an open-a ccess regime, or a free-for -all. A commons has boundaries, rules, social norms and sanctions against free riders."

# State of research

Currently, there are not many studies that investigated cooperation in (urban) commons from a social psychological point of view.

About the study of cooperation in (urban) commons

find studies on commons on a psychological perspective/focus on members?

@Singh2017: "[Hardin's] caricature does not take into account the possibility that the shepherd might grieve the loss of his green valley when it degrades, or that grief might galvanize him into action to avert the tragedy. The affective and communicative relations between the pasture and the shepherd and amongst the shepherds and their power to bring both the commoner and the commons into being remain invisible in this picture"\
"affective and communicative relations between the commons and the commoners can lead to more robust theorizing about the commons, and also possibly help in bringing together divergent ways of thinking about the commons"

=\> focus on more individual, relational aspects (affective), but with a quantitative method + rural common

forest in India

@Nightingale2011: "I take some of these insights into the commons debate to think about the role of subjectivity and emotion in creating durable cooperative agreements. In other words, can we conceptualise a 'non-rational' commons?"

fisheries in ??

@Kopelman2002: review of the factors that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas, here's what they identified on the individual level: gender and social motives (SVO) and power (social status) =\> so not really a focus on identity factors or group dynamic factors

@Gifford1997: study of the cooperation in commons but with mathematical models

@DeCaro2021: "Conventional wisdom (rational choice theory) assumes that individuals are destined to collectively destroy vital ecological systems due to their narrow self-interest. In contrast, Humanistic Rational Choice Theory (HRCT) assumes individuals can cooperatively self-govern, devising effective conservation agreements and governance systems to constrain self-interest for mutual benefit. To test this assumption, we examined the motivational, perceptual, and cooperative outcomes of communication in a resource dilemma experiment"

The Psychology of Social Dilemmas (@VanVugt1998) =\> individual and collective solution to social dilemmas, he talks about SD but to model real-life situation such as water shortage or public transportation

=\> both of VV papers mention social identity but it has not been study in a real common, but just in social dilemma real-life situations

@Feinberg2021 mention the creation of a collective identity as a benefit of urban commons, and this helps resilience of commoners

# Gaps

-   few studies that focused in a psychological way on why do people cooperate in commons =\> most of them studied the commons as a whole, without focusing on the individuals that manage them (see references above)

    -   VV applied social psychology to real-life social dilemmas and showed that identification and social norms are very important motivations when deciding whether to cooperate. However, he did not study this effect in commons as we define them

    -   Singh + Nightindale = non-rational factors such as emotions, ... applied to commons, but not in a quantitative way, and not factor related to social psychology

-   studies about individual factors =\> qualitative, lack of quantitative studies in the field

    -   there are quantitative studies about cooperation in commons, but often they are lab experiments that recreate a commons [e.g @Mosler1993; @Brozyna2018]

-   most of the field study are done in rural commons =\> what about urban commons [@Feinberg2021 did a review about UC, but no field study]

-   SOCIAL IDENTITY IS ALWAYS USED AS A SINGLE CONSTRUCT, BUT IN REAL LIFE PEOPLE HAVE MANY SOCIAL IDENTITIES OVERLAPPING!

# Scope: the case of Switzerland

According to @ONeill2018, Switzerland completely follows the Global North tendency. In fact, of the 7 planetary boundaries, 6 are exceeded, with "Blue water" being the only exception. At the same time, Switzerland achieved 7 out of the 11 social indicators chosen for their research (Country Comparisons, n.d.), while they did not find information for the remaining four, namely "Life satisfaction", "Healthy life expectancy", "Social support" and "Democratic quality". However, according to the OECD Better Life Index, Switzerland perform very well also in these four factors. Therefore, in order to ensure a good life within planetary boundaries for everyone, @ONeill2018 suggest that "provisioning systems must be fundamentally restructured to enable basic needs to be met at a much lower level of resource use" (p. 92).

-   say that in CH most people live in urban contexts (?) =\> find data

-   that's why interest in urban commons

-   explain urban commons...

In this context, urban commons initiatives could be a way to maintain the high levels of social well-being, while allowing to reduce the ecological impact.

housing initiatives in Switzerland as real-life commons =\> why? find the parallelism between the two (see document prepared for the kick-off meeting)

=\> elements of the definition = shared resource self-managed by a community of users, who contributes to sustainability

CODHA: Founded in 1994 as a non-profit organization, CODHA brings together people who want a different kind of housing, a different quality of life, a different relationship with the home, based on participation, conviviality, and solidarity. The cooperative carries out its projects by pooling financial resources and through the active participation of residents. Internal management of the buildings by the residents also enables them to define a living environment closer to their aspirations

WOGENO: Bern: The co-operative WOGENO Bern buys, builds and finances houses in order to permanently remove them from speculation. It provides its members with affordable living and working space. Self-managed, secure and communal forms of housing are realized. WOGENO Bern is a non-profit organisation and stands for a responsible approach to its social and natural environment. ZH: more or less the same, see: <https://www.wogeno-zuerich.ch/genossenschaft/genossenschaft-wogeno-zuerich/>

check here: <https://gen-suisse.ch/it/inizio/> =\> housing initiatives but more on the rural zones, but can be useful to define "eco-villages"

# Research questions & methods

## Research question 1

*Impact of the context on personal factors.*

How does commons' organization influence the social identification of their members?\
Is the strength of the identification moderated by other social groups?

IV1 = number of activities organized by the housing initiative (HI)\
=\> HI level, ask to the contact person

IV2 = degree of (possible) implication of members in the HI organization\
=\> HI level, ask to the contact person

IV3 = personal amount of contacts with other residents\
=\> individual level, survey

DV1 = social identification as a member of the housing initiative\
=\> individual level, survey

DV2 = perception of other residents and of conflicts within the HI\
[idea: do they see the others as "residents like me" or do they use opposite social groups to describe them?]

DV3 = social identification in other social groups\
=\> individual level, survey

control group:

-   identification as a resident of their building

-   perception of other residents

-   identification in other social groups

'+ include control variables both at the individual + HI level

### Social identification in HI

3 hypothesis:

H1: the social identification as a member of HI is higher than the control group's identification as resident of their building

H2: the strength of the social identification as a member of HI positively correlates with the number of activities organized by the HI

H3: the strength of the social identification as a member of HI positively correlates with the degree of (possible) implication in the HI organization

H2 & H3: look for results about formation of social identity?

### Perception of other residents

Possible survey:

"In your HI there are different categories of residents: full-rent, free-rent, ... (see based on the HI, and provide an explanaition of each category).

-   In which one are you?

-   Measure of prejudice towards others categories"

Hypothesis:

H4: the amount of prejudice against other categories negatively correlates with the personal level of contacts with other residents (intergroup contact hypothesis, @Allport1954)

### Social identification in other social groups

Manipulation?

"Imagine a competition with other HI" + equivalent for control group =\> high vs low salience of resident identity (salience of social identity =\> TIS + look for other theories)

H5: the identification in other social groups is stronger in the low salience condition than in the high salience condition

H5.1: this difference is stronger for the experimental group than for the control group

## Research question 2

*Impact of personal factors on the context*

How does the identification as a HI member impact the participation to the management activities/community activities? How does it impact the relationship with others members (trust, communication, importance of social norms, ...)?

## Research question 3

*Intervention*

Can social identification as a member of HI be strengthen by a behavioural intervention? Can such as intervention have positive effects for sustainability?

Ideas: competition between HI about which one consumes less?

## Research question 4

*Impact of HI on society*

Do HI members have a different perspective on society than control group?

How does the "common identity" interact with other social identity such as gender, socio-economic status? =\> literature on intersectionality?

@Feinberg2021: Another source of social tensions, which can also lead to exclusions, is the diverse cultures existing [31] (Bogadi, 2017; Di Feliciantonio, 2017b) and divergent interests or views [28] (D'Souza & Nagendra, 2011; Rao, 2013), potentially causing conflicts (Gilmore, 2017; Huron, 2015).

-   number of common activities = proxy for identity management of the commons? The organization should say how many/how frequent the proposed activity are, and if participation is mandatory

-   measure of "commoners identity" and previous social identity =\> commoners should identify less strongly in previous identity that non commoners? and this difference should be linked to the number of activities that are organized?

    -   same items to measure other social identity + for commoners: "being part of the housing is an important part of my identity", for non-commoners: "being part of the city is an important..." (???)

-   common activity = proposed by the housing community, not at the individual level: the overall activity of the community should predict the identification of the individuals

How does the identification as a commoner impact the participation to the management activities/community activities? How does it impact the relationship with others members (trust, communication, importance of social norms, ...)?

-   opposite than before: activity = individual participation --\> the strength of the identification should predict the level of individual participation

-   measure of social norms about participating in these activities

-   measure of trust on others that will participate in these activities

-   measure of all the other identified factors (?)

=\> find similar questions for the control group!!!

Is it possible to improve the participation to commons activities through an external behavioural intervention?

-   tbd based on the results of previous surveys

LAST RESEARCH QUESTION (maybe?): do commoners and non-commoners have different perspectives on society (inequalities, climate change, trust on others about global issues, ...)? Do this difference evolve over time? =\> contribution of commons to sustainability

=\> few questions to insert in each wave of the survey

Control variables:

-   years of living in the community

-   house level = when was the community created

-   house level = distance from the city center, isolation (can impact the identification), shops (can impact how much members need to go to "normal" shops and therefore isolation)

method = multilevel analysis =\> see the citation Christ et al. (2022) in Matthieu's paper
